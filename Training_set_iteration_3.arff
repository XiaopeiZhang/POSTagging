"PAWS Chicago would like to introduce you to several of the beautiful Pit Bull mixes currently available for adoption at the Adoption Center. Many of these dogs had extended stays at Chicagoâ€™s city pound and were transferred to PAWS Chicago where they could have a second chance at life. Each of these dogs have passed PAWS Chicagoâ€™s temperament and behavior testing and will make wonderful pets for many families. These dogs are a part of PAWS Chicagoâ€™s Pit Pals program which aims to share knowledge about the often misunderstood Pit Bull and works to adopt ambassadors of the breed to loving homes. Through this program, PAWS Chicago works with potential adopters so that they are armed with the knowledge and understanding which will lead to a lifetime of companionship and love with their new furry friend.Click through the photos to meet some of the dogs available for adoption! You may also meet these sweethearts by visiting PAWS Chicagoâ€™s Adoption Center located at 1997 N. Clybourn Ave. For more information about the Pit Pals program, please visit",1,2
